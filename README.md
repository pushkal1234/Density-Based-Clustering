# Density-Based-Clustering
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. This technique is one of the most common clustering algorithms which works based on density of object. The whole idea is that if a particular point belongs to a cluster, it should be near to lots of other points in that cluster.

It works based on two parameters: Epsilon and Minimum Points
Epsilon determine a specified radius that if includes enough number of points within, we call it dense area
minimumSamples determine the minimum number of data points we want in a neighborhood to define a cluster.
